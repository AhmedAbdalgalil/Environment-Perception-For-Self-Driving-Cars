# Environment-Perception-For-Self-Driving-Cars
In this assignment, I will learn how to use the material so far to extract useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment.

In this assignment, I will:

Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.

Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.

Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors.

Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
